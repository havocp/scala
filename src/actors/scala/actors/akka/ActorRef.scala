   * The Future will be completed with an [[akka.actor.AskTimeoutException]] after the given
   * timeout has expired.
   *
   * <b>NOTE:</b>
   * Use this method with care. In most cases it is better to use '!' together with implicit or explicit
   * sender parameter to implement non-blocking request/response message exchanges.
   *
   * If you are sending messages using <code>ask</code> and using blocking operations on the Future, such as
   * 'get', then you <b>have to</b> use <code>getContext().sender().tell(...)</code>
   * in the target actor to send a reply message to the original sender, and thereby completing the Future,
   * otherwise the sender will block until the timeout expires.
   *
   * When using future callbacks, inside actors you need to carefully avoid closing over
   * the containing actorâ€™s reference, i.e. do not call methods or access mutable state
   * on the enclosing actor from within the callback. This would break the actor
   * encapsulation and may introduce synchronization bugs and race conditions because
   * the callback will be scheduled concurrently to the enclosing actor. Unfortunately
   * there is not yet a way to detect these illegal accesses at compile time.
